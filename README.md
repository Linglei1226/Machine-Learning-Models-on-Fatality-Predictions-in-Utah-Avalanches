# Classification Machine Learning Models Optimized by GridSearch: on Fatality Predictions in Utah Avalanches

**Project description** 

An avalanche is a mix of ice and rock debris with a mass of snow, traveling down to destroy everything on its path. 


On average, in the U.S., avalanches kill marked 25 to 30 people each winter season, while even more injured are unmarked in the unpatrolled areas. 
The avalanche is also a common cause of fatalities in mountainous winter climates in Utah. Due to local folks' preferences for skiing or other outdoor snow sports, Avalanches have severely threatened human life. 


Therefore, predicting possible fatalities based on the observed avalanche information is vital. The larger scale in steep areas may cause higher possibilities of death, indicating that the government should assign more human resources and resources to search and rescue potential injuries. At the same time, the small-scaled avalanche that happens in the relatively flat area should be carefully supervised. By classification analysis of the recorded information, our research will assist the government in forecasting the possible death in observed avalanches and making a quick decision on the optimal amount of resources and human resources put into the rescue activities. 


In this project, we will construct predictive models of decision trees and support vector machines for forecasting the occurrence of avalanche fatality. Also, we plan to find the optimal ratio of training versus test dataset for model construction and predictive accuracy by comparing algorithms performances. Choosing the best parameters using cross-validation is also one of the project objectives for both models. 


Ultimately, we will achieve finding the best model with optimal parameters to predict the occurrence of fatality in a given avalanche.
